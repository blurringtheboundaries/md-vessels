This is a markdown version of patcher notation I have been working on for BtB Arts during our Sound Ideas sessions.
I needed a way to write out patches quickly on the fly.

Currently working with Jason Dasent through a @blurringtheboundaries project to ensure compatibility and ease of use with screen reader access.

Uploading some rough notes, this will be a bit of a testing ground since I'm working through a few issues specific to GitHub markdown at the time of writing.
